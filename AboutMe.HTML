                Hi! My name is Lauren and thanks for visiting my site! I decided this year to stop being complacent and to jump out of my comfort zone <br>
                to do something new and fulfilling with my career. After much research, i've decided to change from the HR field to the Software engineering <br>
                field. This site is a project to practice my coding and host different things about me from the different code i've been working on, to my Youtube <br>
                channel, to motherhood topics and more. I am sure later on I can structure this either more towards being my coding portfolio or a blog page/content landing<br>
                site for my social media presents.
